// I'll let you fill this one out.
// Come up with an abstract class to manage all the collisions for your tilemaps.
// The reason we do this is to keep a centralized place to handle repetitive tasks.
// Come up with the API (Application Programming Interface): How you interact with the class first.
// The goal is to create a registry (an array) where you keep track of all collisions that need to happen
// And on the update loop, simply do a CollisionManager.update(); to handle your collisions.
